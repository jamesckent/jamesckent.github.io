# James Kent's Online Portfolio
<br>
Hello World,
<br>
<br>
Welcome to my online portfolio where I will be sharing all my exciting feats as I start on my journey to becoming a fully-fledged coder!
<br>
<br>
## First Assignment
One of my first assignments as I learn to code was to better understand simple agent-based models. I therefore set about creating an agent-based model using the matplotlib library, animated it, added in a stopping condition with a limited number of iterations, and then embedded it into a TkInter GUI.
