# Agent-Based Modelling
<br>
## What is agent-based modelling?
<br>
I have learnt a considerable amount on agent-based modelling curtesy of my university lecturer, Dr Andy Evans. Dr Andy Evans discusses agent-based modelling in-depth in a very informative webpage, which can be found [here]( http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/other/crime/abm/general-modelling/index.html).

Below is a screenshot of the agent-based model I created in my practical.
