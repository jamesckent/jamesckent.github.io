### 1. Introduction
This README file lays out my university coursework which aims to teach us how to construct a simple agent-based model. Under the documentation section, two simple text files can be found. The first is the source code and the second is related to the agents. The code has been developed using the Python IDE, Spyder, version 3.8. When the model is ran, a separate pop up window should open. It should display a GUI which has been created using TkInter. When 'Model' is clicked on the menu bar, it should display the option to run the model. If 'Run model' is clicked, an animation of the simple agent-based model which I created will be displayed. The model is programmed to run for a limited number of iterations until it stops. However, commented out, is also a random generator function which can be used instead.

### 3. Documentation
Below are two simple text documents which detail my attempts to develop a Python program to build a simple agent-based model. The first document titled 'Main model' includes the main class that is run. The second document titled 'Agentframework code' deals with the agents.
